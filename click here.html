    <p> firstly i want to thank you for comming her (i.e by onpening this links). so,i have been whishing you on  your birthday since three years , in the last month i was thinking that " why iam i doing this thing???"  </p>
    <p> Back then in our "tenth class", i was basically a dump, idiot,....etc the reason,you will be knowing by the end of his message , i was a boy who has a dreams of becoming a "super hero" : i mean all those thing what a kid dream off,i was fullof childish metality ,the movement when i saw you was like "you are the best" you are beautiful,inteligent ,smart,talented i guess you are best in all..NOW, you may think iam lieing to you but "this is fact " you are best in all so, at that point of time i thought by seeing you i was <b>loving you </b> but now i realise this is just attraction and it happens to all, i was such stupid tht i don't even i understand the diffrence between this things , well to be frank i guess all the boys in the class are attrated to you (it is just my opinion) ,the diiference is tht they know it is attraction and i don't </p>
    <p>so, i was doing the such things in a dilama of think this is <b>love</b>but don't worry , i finally know this is not what i thought ,i now realise how weard i was behaving to you, i have no intention to disturb you , all iwas trying to do some special things for you which make you fell special,i did it because i thought i was loving you ,but hey there no mistake of you in this iam rsponsible for this, you are always right , you are brought up very well. i just want to make sure that i have no intention to disturb you from bottom of my heart.i think you are understanding what iam trying to tell you, iam really sorry if i mad you fell bad (i guess i did thts the reason i y did this )i am really sorry for the distrubance of my side...   </p>
    <p>finally all i want to say is that "i deeply deeply apologize for all the things, you may think why iam doing this website for you ,the reason is , i just do what my heart say's ,and i did because i may behave wrong with you so, iam seeking for apology, hope you understand what iam trying to say ,i really want to thank you from bottom of my heart,for comming here and reading all this ,and it's your day .i wish you a very happy birthday.AND may god fullfill all your dreams ,and a huge success and happyness in your life .be the way you are,you are the best <b>THANKYOU</b></p>
